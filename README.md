`Hello, world!`

I'm **Altaf**, a scholar studying in Singapore from Indonesia that likes to create and tinker with computers as a hobby.

I make games, websites, used to do robotics, and now videography, and still loves to try new things.

If you want to learn more about me for whatever reason (I don't know why would you), you can visit my [website](https://altafcreator.com)!
